### What is this?

This is a WIP HTML5 game.

### Why Should I Care?

Maybe it will be fun to play at some point. 

### How Do I Play It?

Host the files locally using server.js (I use node-static and hit port 8080). See How Do I Build It Myself

### How Do I Build It Myself?

I built a bundle using browserify: `browserify client.js > bundle.js`. `index.html` has a script tag with `bundle.js` as the SRC.
